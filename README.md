This is a web-based tool that provides search and filtering functionality for a CSV file. The tool provides both a simple mode and an advanced mode. The simple mode functions like a search engine, enabling you to search for any field as a string and return the related rows. The advanced mode provides specific input fields for each column in the CSV file, allowing for more refined filtering of the results.

The tool is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of jQuery and Papa Parse library. It is hosted using Github Pages and is free to use.

## How to use
